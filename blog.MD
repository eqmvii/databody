## A blog 

Here is a collection of thoughts as I work through the hackathon. 

## Redux

#### T+5 hours

I started trying to figure out how to pass state between routes when using React-Router. Quickly discovered a compelling reason to use Redux, and started reading through the docs. 

Eventually decided that my app was simple enough to do something hacky instead, and got something roughed in. It worked once and I went to sleep.

## Gremlins

#### T+13 hours

Woke up and nothing works as well as it did when I went to sleep. Login works, sometimes, really only if the page is refreshed. Logout might just not work. Gotta squash those bugs before moving on and figuring out the next big step, probably setting up the real tables in the PostgreSQL database.
